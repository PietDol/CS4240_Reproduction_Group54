# CS4240_Reproduction_Group54
This repository contains the code used for the reproducibility project for the course CS4240 Deep Learning. The paper we reproduced is: NeRV: Neural Representations for Videos ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13903.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/haochen-rye/NeRV)).

## Run the code
All the code is made in Kaggle. We do different things for the project and all are made in a different notebook. Those different notebooks can be find in this repository. Our results can be reproduced by running our notebooks in Kaggle. Make sure that you have the right folders and upload the utility script in the notebook (some notebooks imports a nervfile with a different name, then make sure that the names are the same). We use the following architecture:
